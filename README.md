## Purpose/Objective: 

The objective was to use Tableau Public to analyze the NYC Citibike trip data for the month of August 2019 and create a Tableau Story providing insights about the project. 

Dataset: [Citibike Trip Data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

## Results:

The following visualizations were used:

This first visualization points out the peak usage hours for the service.

Second visualization shows us that most rides originate in Manhattan as one would expect.

Here it's clear that almost all rides were less than an hour. A tiny portion (around 1k) of bikes extended into the second hour but no rides took longer than 1 hour 20 minutes.

This viz breaks down the tripdurations by gender. Most of the users were male but again, you can see that almost all of the rides took less than an hour.

Fifth visualization in the story shows bike usage by weekday and the time of the day. Commute hours were the busiest from Monday to Friday. On the other hand, service usage was spread out late morning to early evening. 

![NYC Citibike Story (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92544151/167490922-344e64d0-5f56-4ce4-b4ae-402b62c34107.png) ![NYC Citibike Story (7)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92544151/167490959-7dca106f-932e-46da-9a3c-aa08cd5cc456.png)

This one combines the fifth visualization with the gender component and the resulting patterns were as expected.

Vast majority of the users were subscribers and this is enouraging for someone looking to start a similar project. These subscribers guarantee a somewhat consistent revenue stream.

## Summary:

The visualizations help us see and understand the usage patterns better. They make it easier to see who uses the service the most and when they tend to do so. The following two additions would help make the story more informative:

1) A map displaying areas with high usage and the average trip duration for those areas. 
2) Percentage of users residing in the city versus the percentage of tourists.
